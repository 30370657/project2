            <p>For students thinking about studying internationally, the prospect of taking the leap can be both exciting and challenging. Living abroad offers innumerable benefits for growth in both personal and career development. Studying or training in Australia will allow individuals to learn from a different perspective and have access to world-class education. 
Australia is known for its high-quality education, facilities and infrastructure. According to the Universities 21 (U21) Ranking of National Higher Education Systems 2019, the country was recognised as one of the best higher education systems in the world. Australian universities consistently rank in the top 100 universities of the world. 
An Australian qualification gives an edge to students providing more global career opportunities. In partnership with colleges and universities, CareerGro Australia (CGA) facilitates pathways to a diverse set of programs for students interested in studying or training in Australia.</p>
